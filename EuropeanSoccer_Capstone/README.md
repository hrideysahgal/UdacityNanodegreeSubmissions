## European Soccer Capstone Project

My submission to udacity's machine learning engineer nanodegree course. The project analyses the prediction of matches in
European football, using the dataset at [European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).


### IPython Notebooks
* [Notebook for match outcome prediction](Notebook_Code/Match_outcome_prediction.ipynb)
* [Notebook for Players' clustering mini project](Notebook_Code/Players_clustering.ipynb)

Please note that as the data is huge, I would not advise running the whole notebook at once. Some of the code cells are merely 
for demonstrative purposes, i.e. they do work; however a lot of the results were generated and saved into files. See the section 
Data Structures below for information on the files.

### Data_Structures
This folder contains the .csv files with feature data; and also intermediate feature files. These files are used by the notebooks
to read data and analyze.

### Data
Raw data containing the soccer database data in the form of a zip file.

### Notebook_Code

* Contains the notebooks for the project.

* Contains the background python code that the notebooks use.

### Proposal

Folder containing the project proposal and related files.

### Final Report
Folder containing the final project report and related files.
