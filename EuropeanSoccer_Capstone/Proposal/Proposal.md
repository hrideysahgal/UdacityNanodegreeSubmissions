## Domain Background

Football (or *soccer*) is the biggest global sport and is a fast-growing multibillion dollar industry; with an estimate of 27 billion dollars in terms of annual revenue for the football clubs [1]. With more and more money pouring into the sport, the betting industry for predicting the outcome of matches is worth a billions pounds every year [2]. The *ridiculous* amount of money can be summed in the chart below, that shows the amount of money clubs have paid to secure a football player's services (*I being a mere mortal find myself counting the number of zeros in these huge sums of money*).

Prediction of soccer matches is a tough problem. Predicting the exact scoreline is a near impossible task. The game involves emotional factors such as the passion of the crowd, how pumped the players are that day, players' personal lives; factors which are beyond measure. In this project, I wish to tackle the problem using factors we can indeed measure.

### Personal Motivation
I would divide my motivation to do this project into two reasons

* ***My Interest and domain knowledge*** in this field. I follow European soccer with passion and interest. I would like to use my domain knowledge to come up with questions interesting to me, and help me solve those questions.
* ***Feature selection***, the biggest take away for me from this nanodegree course is the importance of feature selection, and finding correlations between features. The project on customer segments gave me a chance to apply some techniques such as *PCA* to reduce dimensionality; and I would like to apply them to this problem, in conjunction with my domain knoweldge.

## Problem Statement
## TODO: THIS SECTION
https://github.com/sgoyal1012/UdacityNanodegreeSubmissions/blob/master/EuropeanSoccer_Capstone/Proposal/Scribbe_Notes.md
Who wins? (Benchmark seems ~53%). Can you beat the bookies?

Which team will win the upcoming season?
Which is the most predicatble league?
Make a predicted league table! Have every team play each other and Compare results from coming year as a test data and see positions. (Make a web app! ?)
From a fan's perspective

Model ticket prices, season ticket prices: compare with truth.
The pull of star power- real madrid vs barcelona is the most expensive
The probability of an upset?

Try clustering teams/players based on success/money/trophies.

- Silhouette coefficient for cluster efficiency
Red cards and racism
