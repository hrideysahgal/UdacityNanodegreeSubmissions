## IDEAS

* USE PCA on both players and matches to see the most relevant features (think of the grocery project): 
correlated features heat map.
* Try different models.
* The problem here is getting the best features.
  - Feature selection
* The pull of ***star power*** - Messi, CR7, Bale, De Gea  
- Adding features (no. of top ten players in the team, top 100 players)

## Questions

### Who wins? (Benchmark seems ~53%). Can you beat the bookies? 
  - Which team  will win the upcoming season? 
  - Which is the most predicatble league?
  - Make a predicted league table! Have every team play each other and
  Compare results from coming year as a test data and see positions. (Make a web app! ?)
  
### From a fan's perspective
- Model ticket prices, season ticket prices: compare with truth.
- The pull of star power- real madrid vs barcelona is the most expensive

### The probability of an upset?

### Try clustering teams/players based on success/money/trophies.
    - Silhouette coefficient for cluster efficiency

### Red cards and racism

## Application/UI

- A UI that accepts a year and a league; and predicts the table.
- Plot on a world map, the leagues where one has to spend the most money.
- Plot as a heat map, the world's most predictable league.
