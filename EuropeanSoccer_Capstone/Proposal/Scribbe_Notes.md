## Questions

### Who wins? (Benchmark seems ~53%). Can you beat the bookies? 
  - Which team  will win the upcoming season? 
  - Which is the most predicatble league?
  - Make a predicted league table! Have every team play each other and
  Compare results from coming year as a test data and see positions. (Make a web app! ?)

### The probability of an upset?

### Try clustering teams/players based on success/money/trophies.
    - Silhouette coefficient for cluster efficiency

### Red cards and racism
